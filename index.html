        <h1>"To install, drag this icon..." no more!</h1>

<p>Let's see if we can get the elegance, simplicity, and speed of Homebrew for the
installation and management GUI Mac applications like Google Chrome and Adium.</p>

<p><code>brew-cask</code> provides a friendly homebrew-style CLI workflow for the
administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries.</p>

<p>It's implemented as a <code>homebrew</code> "<a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/External-Commands">external
command</a>" called
<code>cask</code>.</p>

<h1>Let's try it!</h1>

<h2>Get brew-cask</h2>

<p>Tap this repository and install the <code>brew-cask</code> tool:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew tap phinze/homebrew-cask
$ brew install brew-cask
</code></pre>

<h2>Now let's install our first Cask</h2>

<p>Let's see if there's a Cask for Chrome:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew cask search chrome
google-chrome
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, there it is.  Let's install it.</p>

<pre><code>$ brew cask install google-chrome
Downloading...
Success! google-chrome installed to /usr/local/Cellar/google-chrome/stable-channel
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have <code>Google Chrome.app</code> in our Cellar. Cool.</p>

<p>If you like, it's easy to get it linked somewhere more visible (see <a href="#alfred-integration">"Alfred
Integration"</a> below for an idea that makes this step
unnecessary):</p>

<pre><code>$ brew cask linkapps
/Users/phinze/Applications/Google Chrome.app -&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/google-chrome/17.0.963.56/Google Chrome.app
</code></pre>

<p>And there we have it.  Google Chrome installed with a few quick commands; no clicking, no dragging, no dropping.</p>

<pre><code>open "~/Applications/Google Chrome.app"
</code></pre>

<h1>What Casks are available?</h1>

<p>Just run <code>brew cask search</code> with no arguments to get a list.</p>

<h1>How do I update brew-cask?</h1>

<p>Since this repository is a Tap, you'll pull down the latest Casks with a simple
<code>brew-update</code>. When the <code>brew-cask</code> tool itself is updated, it will show in
<code>brew outdated</code> and you can upgrade it via the normal Homebrew workflow.</p>

<h1>What is a Cask?</h1>

<p>A <code>Cask</code> is like a <code>Formula</code> in Homebrew except it describes how to download
and install a binary application.</p>

<p>Casks currently have three fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>url</strong>: (required) points to binary distribution of the application</li>
<li>
<strong>version</strong>: (required) describes the version of the application available at the URL</li>
<li>
<strong>homepage</strong>: the same as Homebrew's - it doesn't do anything yet, but will be wired in</li>
</ul><h1>What's the status of this project?  Where's it headed?</h1>

<p>It's really just a start at this point, but it works, and I've got big plans!</p>

<p><code>brew-cask</code> currently understands how to install <code>dmg</code> and <code>zip</code> files that
contain a <code>.app</code> file.  I'd like to extend it to be able to handle <code>pkg</code> files
as well as the numerous other permutations of compression and distribution in
the wild (<code>.app</code> inside <code>dmg</code> inside <code>zip</code>; folder inside <code>dmg</code>; etc.).</p>

<p>I plan to use the <code>Cask</code> model to allow per-project customization of behavior,
like Homebrew does with <code>Formula</code>.  This would allow weirdo applications like,
say, Eclipse ("you really want me to drag that whole <em>folder</em> to
<code>Applications</code>? ew.") to contain their complexity.</p>

<p>Each Cask will then encapsulate and automate the story of how a given
application should be installed.  If all goes well - I'm hoping to build up a
community-maintained collection of Casks that becomes the standard way that
hackers install Mac apps.</p>

<h1>Can I contribute?</h1>

<p><strong>Yes, yes, yes!</strong> Please fork/pull request to update Casks, to add features,
to clean up documentation--anything at all that you can do to help out is very
welcome.</p>

<p>It's also <strong>pretty darn easy</strong> to create Casks, so please build more of them
for the software you use. And if <code>brew-cask</code> doesn't support the packaging
format of your software, please open an issue and we can get it working
together.</p>

<p>The whole idea is to build a <em>community-maintained</em> list of easily installable
packages, so the community part is important! Every little bit counts.</p>

<h1>Alfred Integration</h1>

<p>I've been using Casks along with Alfred to great effect.  Just add
<code>/usr/local/Cellar</code> as a Search Scope in Alfred's preferences, and then
applications become available in Alfred immediately after a <code>brew cask
install</code>.  Your fingertips will thank you.</p>

<p>With this setup, you don't actually need <code>brew cask linkapps</code> if you always
open your apps from Alfred. This means that everything stays nice and tidy.</p>

<p>Oh, and you can <code>brew cask install alfred</code> too! Not bad, eh?</p>
